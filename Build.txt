Build file for BBWin
==============================================================

This file explains how to build BBWin from the source code.


Getting the latest source code
==============================

BBWin is developed in C++ (the Standard Template Library and the Standard C++ Library
are used)
The source code of BBWin is available from the sourceforge subversion
repository for the BBWin projects :
http://bbwin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bbwin/


Install the tools
=================

BBWin has been developed with the help of some tools. You should install them to 
build BBWin easily without any problems.

o Visual C++ Express 2010
  http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/

o Windows Platform SDK 2003
  You can download it for free from Microsoft's website :
  http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=6510

o Windows Installer XML (WiX) Toolkit : this package is used to build the BBWin MSI installer
  You should install it and include the WiX bin directory in your current path
  http://wix.codeplex.com/

o TinyXML : BBWin uses the excellent TinyXML library for the XML configuration loading.
  You do not need to install it - TinyXML source code is included in BBWin's.

o Boost Lib : These C++ libraries are used for some agents and will certainly be
  used in the BBWin core service in the future.
  You can download the binary installers from:
  http://www.boostpro.com/download/
  Once installed, add an environment variable BoostInstallDir pointing to the boost install directory.
  Example:
  BoostInstallDir=C:\BOOST

o Microsoft HTML Help Workshop : This is used in the setup Makefile to compile the BBWin.chm help file.
  You can download the installation package from:
  http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21138
  Once installed, add the program folder to your PATH.


Building BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2010
===========================================

Open the BBWin.sln file at the top directory of the project
First, you should prepare your Visual C++ configuration by adding
in the default bin, include and lib directories from :

- the platform SDK
- the boost libraries

Then just build the solution.

Building process order
======================

1) BBWin core service
2) Agents
3) Externals (needing compilation)

 <P>BBWin features include:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI><b>Native service:</b> BBWin works as a native Windows service.
 <LI><b>BBWin agent architecture:</b> BBWin has been developed to work using agents (DLL files) so
 the service just runs as a daemon, scheduling the different agents loaded.
 Each monitoring task has its own agent. For example, cpu monitoring is achieved by loading cpu.dll, memory
 monitoring by loading memory.dll. With this architecture, the BBWin user can build his or her own monitoring solution
 by deleting agents that will never used. A small API is available to make developing of new native BBWin agents a simple task.
 <LI><b>Many agents available:</b> BBWin is shipped with several agents, such as cpu, disk, externals, memory, 
 network stats, procs, services and uptime
 which is sufficient to monitor most servers.
 <LI><b>Externals support:</b> BBWin provides the externals agent which permits you to use your own
 scripts to add bespoke monitoring. Externals permits you to enhance 
 the monitoring very easily.
 <LI><b>Xymon Centralized compatible:</b> BBWin can work in the same way as Unix Xymon clients with a fully centralized configuration on the Xymon server.</LI>
 <LI><b>Big Brother compatible:</b> BBWin has the ambition to be the preferred Xymon client for
 Windows. However, because some people are still using the commercial Big Brother software, BBWin
 is compatible with the Big Brother server implementation (implementing some features that don't exist on Xymon). 
 With this interesting compatibility, people who couldn't migrate to Xymon for the server side can first replace their
 Big Brother client by installing BBWin.
 <li><b>BBWin command line utility:</b> BBWin is shipped with an executable called BBWinCmd.exe 
 which implements a large part of the Big Brother / Xymon protocol. You can use it to delete or
 rename hosts, for example, or to diagnose network problems.
 <li><b>Extra tools:</b> BBWin provides you with some tools in addition to the common agents. The package is shipped
 with some migration utilities for converting configurations from other Big Brother clients to the BBWin configuration
 file format in a second. Also, some external agents are shipped to monitor WLBS clusters, MSCS clusters or 
 simple folders.
 <LI><b>XML configuration format:  </b>BBWin configuration is stored in a file called BBWin.cfg. This file is in XML format and
 stores all the settings for BBWin. This allows you to easily backup the configuration or create template BBWin configurations
 for different types of servers (Web server, Database server or Application server).
 <LI><b>Native MSI installer:</b> BBWin is shipped as a native Windows Installer package. It will help you
 to deploy it easily and quickly in your server infrastructure.</LI>

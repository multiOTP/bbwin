ChangeLog file for BBWin
==============================================================


BBWin 0.9 Preview version - December 5th 2006
-------------------


+ New Features
* Msgs agent reports events username and you may filter event with user name
* Msgs agent reports some statistics about each event log file. You can activate
  an option which alert you when an event log is full. See the help chm file for details.
* New BBWinUpdate agent : it used for the semi centralized mode. You can configure the agent
  to download configurations updates from a central hobbit server.
* First version of BBWin centralized mode implemented. Backend for hobbit not coded.
  Look at the BBWin.cfg example in the doc folder or in the documentation

+ Updates
* system uptime sometimes returns 0 seconds on the first query. BBWin now send 
  a green status when this happens to avoid incorrect alerts.
* msgs now formats description field in status so you don't have to scroll your window
  to read a large event description
* disk agent reported alerts on unrecognized disks (like disks part of cluster resources on
  the inactive node of an MSCS cluster). These disks are now automatically ignored.
* cluster.exe is more verbose when it check the Windows version
* procs agent now is using rules with signs '+' or '-' because XML format doesn't accept
  '<' sign in attributes ... However, the compatibility with '<' and '>' is preserved.
* msgs summary option is removed. It is enabled by default and there is no use to disable it.

+ Bugs
* limit option for cpu agent was wrong in the number of lines reported, it is fixed.
* When an agent had no configuration in BBWin.cfg and if it was loaded, BBWin crashed, it is fixed.
* msgs agent had a memory leak when an initialization was made to get event description. it is fixed.
* wlbs script external had a bug to load the configuration file. it is fixed.
* cpu agent were always missing one process in the ps report. it is fixed.
* externals agent was crashing BBWin if its configuration was empty. it is fixed.



BBWin 0.8 Preview version - 01 August 2006
-------------------

+ New Features
* svcs agent has now a delay setting which tell the agent to do not 
  monitor the Windows services for a short time after the startup 
  of the computer
* Msgs agent have priority and count options
* You may use environment variables for hostname and paths settings (registry and BBWin.cfg)
* Cpu agent can monitor uptime like the original Big Brother client. It is off by default.
* Cpu agent reports usage for each cpu
* ext directory is now created at the installation so the tree really looks like hobbit tree.
* hostname, logpath, binpath, etcpath, tmppath, extpath registry settings can be environment variables (e.g.: %VARNAME%)
* default hostname is %COMPUTERNAME%


+ Updates
* cpu agent on multi processor computers is now sending the correct cpu
  usage
* disk is now reporting correctly disk which had a size smaller than 1 mb
* autoreload is now on by default
* BBWin doesn't exits any more on errors
* Msgs default delay for matchs rules may be overridden by a generic setting
* Msgs now reports date with 24h time format

+ Important note :
* A memory leak has been discovered in BBWin 0.7 due to a bug in the CRT library shipped
with Visual C++ 2005. I'm forced to use the Visual ToolKit 2003 since not update
is available yet for this bug. (SP1 public download not yet available)

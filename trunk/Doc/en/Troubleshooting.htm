<H3>Why BBWin can't start !!??</H3>

<p>
If BBWin can't start or doesn't seem to report to your bbdisplay.
You should first check your application event log, BBWin will report
errors in it so you will be able to find out what is wrong in 
your configuration.
</p>
<p>
Also, you can enable the BBWin logging report feature which will
trace important events in a simple text file.
</p>
<p>
2 settings are availables:
</UL>
<LI> loglevel : 0 no log, 1 errors, 2 warnings, 3 information, 4 debug
loglevel 4 is the most verbose mode.
If not configured, default loglevel is 0.

<LI> logpath : path file of the logfile. If not configured, default logpath is "C:\Program Files\BBWin\logs\BBWin.log"

</UL>

<H3>I still really don't understand why it doesn't work !!!</H3>


<p>
